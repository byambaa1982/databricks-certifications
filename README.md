# 🎓 databricks-certifications

Study notes, practice material, and exam-prep resources for the **Databricks certification** tracks — organized one folder per exam.

Sister repo to [**lakehouse-starter**](https://github.com/byambaa1982/lakehouse-starter), a deployable Asset Bundle where the concepts from these exams (medallion architecture, DLT/Lakeflow, CDC → SCD Type 2, Unity Catalog, bundles CI/CD) run for real. Read here, practice there.

Every certification folder follows the same shape:

```
<certification>/
├── README.md                      # the exam's sections + weights, mapped to folders
└── NN-<section-name>/             # one folder per OFFICIAL exam-guide section
    ├── README.md                  # run order, setup, how to study, the section's traps
    ├── 00_setup.py                # (where needed) builds deterministic practice data
    └── NN_<topic>.py              # runnable Databricks notebooks with exam-trap callouts
```

Notebooks are stored as `.py` source (`# Databricks notebook source`) —
import a folder into your workspace and run them. Practice data is
hash-deterministic with blemishes planted where lessons need them; the
[lab environments map](resources/lab-environments.md) shows what each track
builds and how to reset it.

## How I study

1. **Read the official exam guide first** — every exam page above links one. The section folders mirror its headings and weights, so coverage gaps are visible.
2. **Do it, don't just read it** — every concept that can run, runs: predict each cell's output before executing it, because that's exactly the skill the exams test. Labs lean on a [lakehouse-starter](https://github.com/byambaa1982/lakehouse-starter) dev deployment (serverless — a run costs cents).
3. **Drill with timed practice tests** — I built [TestHub](https://testlogichub.com) for exactly this: timed practice exams with explanations, starting with Data Engineer Associate.
